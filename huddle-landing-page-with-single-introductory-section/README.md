## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Learned how to properly position background images. I took help from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position)
- Slowly getting comfortable with SCSS
- This time I made it responsive for three screen sizes unlike previous projects where i made it just for two. (375px, 992px, 1200px)

### Continued development

- Keep practicing CSS. 
- Also include JS projects soon.
- Will try to make projects responsive on more than 3 screen sizes.
- Work on screen reader accessibility

### Useful resources

- [ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - I took all the icons from this website. It offers free icons.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Took fonts from google font.
