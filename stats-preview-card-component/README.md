## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- VsCode
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Used [overflow: hidden] property to properly apply border-radius.
- Applied color overlay over an image for the first time. [mix-blend-mode: multiply] 
- This was my second project using SCSS. Slowly getting the hang of it.

### Continued development

- I have made it just mobile and desktop responsive. Need to work on more screen breakpoints in future projects.
- Need to implement use of 'em' and 'rem'. I am used to 'px' which I know is considered bad practice for some properties. 
- Also need to develop habit of using proper tags in html markup. Avoid using heading tag unnecessarily when not required.
- Learn HTML5 Accessibility habits.
