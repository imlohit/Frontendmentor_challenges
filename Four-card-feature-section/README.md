## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Mobile-first-workflow



### What I learned

For the first time before starting the project, I sketched a Rough drawing of the project on a piece of paper and straightaway I started seeing the results. I was better prepared this time to tackle the mobile first workflow and easily used flexbox in media queries to make it desktop responsive. I completed the project a lot quicker too compared to previous projects. Definitely going to implement this drawing habit for all my future projects. 


### Continued development

There were many repeated piece of codes in my project. I can use Sass to minimise the repeatation. Will try to include sass in my future project.
