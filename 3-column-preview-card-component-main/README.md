### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- media-queries

### What I learned

On my first try I made it desktop first and was finding it difficult to make it responsive for mobile version. But then I went through few youtube videos explaining media queries. Then i refactored my project and made it mobile first which is considered a good practice which i ultimately realised while coding it. Also, i learned how important box-sizing property is in css. I am satisfied with my end result,although i know there is always a room to improve. 

### Continued development

In my future projects i will try to use css custom properties like css variables.
