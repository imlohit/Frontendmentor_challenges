## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS COde
- Google-fonts

### What I learned

I implemented SCSS for the very first time in my project. it turned out pretty good i guess. Mostly the variables and nesting concept was used here. I can see myself improving in CSS. The rough sketch of the layout in the beginning helps a lot.  

### Continued development

--Need to practice more projects using SCSS to get comfortable using it. Also will try to include @mixins in my code.
--Currently learning Javascript and my next goal is to do projects on js.
